  abstract  = {High-quality and complete reference genome assemblies are
               fundamental for the application of genomics to biology, disease,
               and biodiversity conservation. However, such assemblies are
               available for only a few non-microbial species1--4. To address
               this issue, the international Genome 10K (G10K) consortium5,6
               has worked over a five-year period to evaluate and develop
               cost-effective methods for assembling highly accurate and nearly
               complete reference genomes. Here we present lessons learned from
               generating assemblies for 16 species that represent six major
               vertebrate lineages. We confirm that long-read sequencing
               technologies are essential for maximizing genome quality, and
               that unresolved complex repeats and haplotype heterozygosity are
               major sources of assembly error when not handled correctly. Our
               assemblies correct substantial errors, add missing sequence in
               some of the best historical reference genomes, and reveal
               biological discoveries. These include the identification of many
               false gene duplications, increases in gene sizes, chromosome
               rearrangements that are specific to lineages, a repeated
               independent chromosome breakpoint in bat genomes, and a
               canonical GC-rich pattern in protein-coding genes and their
               regulatory regions. Adopting these lessons, we have embarked on
               the Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP), an international effort to
               generate high-quality, complete reference genomes for all of the
               roughly 70,000 extant vertebrate species and to help to enable a
               new era of discovery across the life sciences. The Vertebrate
               Genome Project has used an optimized pipeline to generate
               high-quality genome assemblies for sixteen species (representing
               all major vertebrate classes), which have led to new biological
               insights.},

               complementary long-read sequencing technologies to complete the
               linear assembly of human chromosome 8. Our assembly resolves the
               sequence of five previously long-standing gaps, including a
               2.08-Mb centromeric $\alpha$-satellite array, a 644-kb copy
               number polymorphism in the $\beta$-defensin gene cluster that is
               important for disease risk, and an 863-kb variable number tandem
               repeat at chromosome 8q21.2 that can function as a
               neocentromere. We show that the centromeric $\alpha$-satellite
               array is generally methylated except for a 73-kb hypomethylated
               region of diverse higher-order $\alpha$-satellites enriched with
               CENP-A nucleosomes, consistent with the location of the
               kinetochore. In addition, we confirm the overall organization
               and methylation pattern of the centromere in a diploid human
               genome. Using a dual long-read sequencing approach, we complete
               high-quality draft assemblies of the orthologous centromere from
               chromosome 8 in chimpanzee, orangutan and macaque to reconstruct
               its evolutionary history. Comparative and phylogenetic analyses
               show that the higher-order $\alpha$-satellite structure evolved
               in the great ape ancestor with a layered symmetry, in which more
               ancient higher-order repeats locate peripherally to monomeric
               $\alpha$-satellites. We estimate that the mutation rate of
               centromeric satellite DNA is accelerated by more than 2.2-fold
               compared to the unique portions of the genome, and this
               acceleration extends into the flanking sequence. The complete
               assembly of human chromosome 8 resolves previous gaps and
               reveals hidden complex forms of genetic variation, enabling
               functional and evolutionary characterization of primate

              Using an efficient data structure called a suffix tree, the
              system is able to rapidly align sequences containing millions of

              Sequencing Consortium published their initial drafts of the human
              genome, which revolutionized the field of genomics. While these
              drafts and the updates that followed effectively covered the
              euchromatic fraction of the genome, the heterochromatin and many
              other complex regions were left unfinished or erroneous.
              Addressing this remaining 8\% of the genome, the
              Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium has finished the first
              truly complete 3.055 billion base pair (bp) sequence of a human
              genome, representing the largest improvement to the human
              reference genome since its initial release. The new T2T-CHM13
              reference includes gapless assemblies for all 22 autosomes plus
              chromosome X, corrects numerous errors, and introduces nearly 200
              million bp of novel sequence containing 2,226 paralogous gene
              copies, 115 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The
              newly completed regions include all centromeric satellite arrays
              and the short arms of all five acrocentric chromosomes, unlocking
              these complex regions of the genome to variational and functional

               of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of
               plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses
               should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.
               Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of
               results on the original or even new data. However,
               reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an
               analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the
               field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is
               equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The
               former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer
               extended or slightly different research questions. The latter

  abstract = {After two decades of improvements, the current human reference
              genome (GRCh38) is the most accurate and complete vertebrate
              genome ever produced. However, no single chromosome has been
              finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist1,2.
              Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the
              continuity of GRCh382, along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere
              assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by
              high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the
              complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with
              complementary technologies for quality improvement and
              validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome3, we
              reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately
              3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current
              reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal
              regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and
              GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human
              reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome
              X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map
              methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite
              arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human
              genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will
              facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human
              chromosomes.},

  title    = {Minimap2: pairwise alignment for nucleotide sequences},
  author   = {Li, Heng},
  abstract = {Motivation: Recent advances in sequencing technologies promise
              ultra-long reads of ∼100 kb in average, full-length mRNA or cDNA
              reads in high throughput and genomic contigs over 100 Mb in
              length. Existing alignment programs are unable or inefficient to
              process such data at scale, which presses for the development of
              new alignment algorithms. Results: Minimap2 is a general-purpose
              alignment program to map DNA or long mRNA sequences against a
              large reference database. It works with accurate short reads of
              $\geq$100 bp in length, $\geq$1 kb genomic reads at error rate
              ∼15\%, full-length noisy Direct RNA or cDNA reads and assembly
              contigs or closely related full chromosomes of hundreds of
              megabases in length. Minimap2 does split-read alignment, employs
              concave gap cost for long insertions and deletions and introduces
              new heuristics to reduce spurious alignments. It is 3-4 times as
              fast as mainstream short-read mappers at comparable accuracy, and
              is $\geq$30 times faster than long-read genomic or cDNA mappers
              at higher accuracy, surpassing most aligners specialized in one
              type of alignment. Availability and implementation:

@article{Abdennur2020-lz,
  title    = {Cooler: scalable storage for {Hi-C} data and other genomically
              labeled arrays},
  author   = {Abdennur, Nezar and Mirny, Leonid A},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Most existing coverage-based (epi)genomic datasets
              are one-dimensional, but newer technologies probing interactions
              (physical, genetic, etc.) produce quantitative maps with
              two-dimensional genomic coordinate systems. Storage and
              computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such
              maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to
              develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of
              useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking
              advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient
              compression and providing fast random access to facilitate
              development of scalable algorithms for data analysis. RESULTS: We
              developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data
              model, that can support genomically labeled matrices at any
              resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various
              descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and
              bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns and
              metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python
              library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and
              manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted
              as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium. AVAILABILITY AND
              IMPLEMENTATION: Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed and can be
              installed from the Python package index or the bioconda
              repository. The source code is maintained on Github at
              https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:
